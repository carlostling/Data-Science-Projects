First, how do we learn about the world? This involves both the\n","problem of modeling our initial uncertainty about the world, and that of drawing conclusions from evidence and our initial belief. Secondly, given what we\n","currently know about the world, how should we decide what to do, taking into\n","account future events and observations that may change our conclusions?\n","Typically, this will involve creating long-term plans covering possible future\n","eventualities. That is, when planning under uncertainty, we also need to take\n","into account what possible future knowledge could be generated when implementing our plans. Intuitively, executing plans which involve trying out new\n","things should give more information, but it is hard to tell whether this information will be beneficial.

The agent would keep doing the same action over and over as it has so far been proven to be the best one out of the ones the agent had tested. Alongside this, if the agent does not explore at all then the agent would not be changing its policy from the very beginning, meaning that the agent would be stuck doing its initial steps until terminated. Furthermore, since Q is initialized with only zeros exploration is required to determine the first steps.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"4lx-oSVJekuW","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## Question 4 (0.5 point)\n","\n","Give a summary of how a decision tree works ?"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"SrALqirhAcdu","colab_type":"text"},"source":["A decision tree is a tree using a flowchart like structure and traversing it has the datapoint that you want to predict the class of to answer a question in each node and following the path implied by their answer.
